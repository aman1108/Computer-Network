What we have done?
he have develop a simple multi-threaded Server in Java that is capable of processing multiple requests i.e. more than one client should be able to connect to the server.
Our server should be able to maintain connections with client as long as the client wants to maintain it.


There are 2 java files: Server.java and Client.java. As is clear by the names, the former file implements a multi-threaded server while the latter implements a client.
The default port for server and client is 1222. In case you don't specify the port no., the server runs on port 1222. Also, the default host is 'localhost'. The client runs on localhost and port 1222 by default.
The class used to create multiple threads for handling multiple clients is private and is written in Server_2015085.java. The class name is ClientThread.
Server must run before the clients.

Compile the code using the following lines:
javac Server.java
javac Client.java

Run the code:
java Server 1222
java Client localhost 1222
