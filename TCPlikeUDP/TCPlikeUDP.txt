Reliable version of UDP by implementing TCP like functionalities over a UDP connection.

We have done it by 
1) Implementing the following over a stream of UDP packets; 
2) Implementating same as in the TCP (Reno): 
	a. Acknowledgement: Both single packet and cumulative ack. 
	b. Sequence number: same as in TCP 
	c. Retransmissions 
	d. Detecting duplicates and discarding them. 
	e. Congestion control (TCP Reno) 
	f. Flow Control

3) Also have to develop other necessary programs that will let us test these functionalities. 
This may require the following (and some more): 
	a. A UDP client and server 
	b. a mechanism to generate a large number of UDP packets that act as both packet or acknowledgements depending on the need. c. a random way of deleting some packets so that you can simulate/show loss or delayed arrival.
